Overview
========

Feature Toggles (also known as Feature Flags, Feature Flippers, or Feature Switches) consist on surrounding features (functionalities) in the code with if statements to gain more control over their release process. By surrounding a feature with a toggle (if statement), developers can decide when and for whom the feature should be available. 

This repository contains all data used for the research described in the paper "How the adoption of feature toggles affects branch merges and defects in open-source projects?"

Datasets
========

We list in the following the datasets used to answer each one of the research questions:

- [RQ1: Characterization (n=949)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/C_cleaned.xlsx)
- [RQ2.1: Normalized number of merges (n=158)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/CRQ2_1.xlsx)
- [RQ2.2: Effort per merge (n=158)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/CRQ2_2.xlsx)
- [RQ2.3: Normalized merge effort (n=158)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/CRQ2_3.xlsx)
- [RQ3.1: Normalized number of defects (n=79)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/CRQ3_1.xlsx)
- [RQ3.2: Time to fix a defect (n=79)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/CRQ3_2.xlsx)
- [RQ3.3: Normalized time fixing defects (n=79)](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/CRQ3_3.xlsx)


Detailed Reproducibility Instructions
=====================================

Corpus Filtering:

- RQ1: No further actions are needed.
- RQ2: To calculate the threshold, we ran the [filter_RQ2.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/filter_RQ2.txt) R script. Based on the results, we applied a filter requiring 82 commits, before and after feature toggles (qtde_commit_s_fw and qtde_commit_c_fw), over the corpus of RQ1 and produced the corpus for RQ2.
- RQ3: To calculate the threshold, we ran the [filter_RQ3.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/filter_RQ3.txt) R script. Based on the results, we applied a filter requiring 132 commits, before and after feature toggles (qtde_commit_s_fw and qtde_commit_c_fw), over the corpus of RQ1 and produced the corpus for RQ3.

Research Questions' Analyses:

- RQ1: The analysis of the average moment of adoption for each programming language is described in [dispersao.xlsx](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Dataset/dispersao.xlsx).
- RQ2.1: To obtain the results of the analysis for this research question, run [RQ2_1.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ2_1.txt) in R. The scatter plot is generated by [RQ_2_1_scatter_plot.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ_2_1_scatter_plot.txt). The programming languages analysis is generated by [RQ2_1_PROGLAN.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ2_1_PROGLAN.txt).
- RQ2.2: To obtain the results of the analysis for this research question, run [RQ2_2.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ2_2.txt) in R.
- RQ2.3: To obtain the results of the analysis for this research question, run [RQ2_3.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ2_3.txt) in R.
- RQ3.1: To obtain the results of the analysis for this research question, run [RQ3_1.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ3_1.txt) in R.
- RQ3.2: To obtain the results of the analysis for this research question, run [RQ3_2.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ3_2.txt) in R.
- RQ3.3: To obtain the results of the analysis for this research question, run [RQ3_3.txt](https://github.com/gems-uff/feature-toggles/raw/master/R%20Scripts/Scripts/RQ3_3.txt) in R.
